### Diffusion Monte Carlo method on small boron clusters using single- and multi- determinant–Jastrow trial wavefunctions

Multireference character in some small boron clusters could be significant, and a previous all-electron fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculation with the single-determinant-Jastrow (SDJ) trial wavefunction shows that the atomization energy (AE) of B4+ is overestimated by about 1.4 eV compared with the coupled cluster method with single, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] results. All-electron FN-DMC calculations and those with the pseudopotential (PP) using SDJ and multi-determinant-Jastrow (MDJ) trial wavefunctions with B3LYP orbitals as well as CC calculations at different levels are carried out on BnQ (n = 1–5, Q = −1, 0, 1) clusters. The obtained FN-DMC energies indicate that the node error of the employed SDJ trial wavefunction in all-electron calculations is different from that with the PP for some clusters. The error of AEs and dissociation energies (DEs) from all-electron FN-DMC calculations is larger than that with the PP when the SDJ trial wavefunction is employed, while errors of CC methods do not depend on whether the PP is used. AEs and DEs of the boron clusters are improved significantly when MDJ trial wavefunctions are used in both all-electron calculations and those with the PP, and their error is similar to that of CCSD(T) compared with CCSDT(Q) results. On the other hand, reasonable adiabatic electron detachment energies (ADEs) and ionization potentials (AIPs) are achieved with FN-DMC using SDJ trial wavefunctions and MDJ is less effective on ADEs and AIPs. Furthermore, the relative energy between two structures of B9− is predicted reliably with FN-DMC using the SDJ trial wavefunction and the effect of MDJ is negligible, while density functional theory results using different exchange-correlation functionals differ significantly.
