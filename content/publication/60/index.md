abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory based Ehrenfest dynamics with atom-centered basis functions is developed in present work. The equation of motion for electrons is formulated in terms of first-order reduced density matrix and an additional term arises due to the time-dependence of basis functions through their dependence on nuclear coordinates. This time-dependence of basis functions together with the imaginary part of density matrix leads to an additional term for nuclear force. The effects of the two additional terms are examined by studying the dynamics of H2 and C2H4, and it is concluded that the inclusion of these two terms is essential for correct electronic and nuclear dynamics.
