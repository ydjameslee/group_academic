abstract: A linear-scaling first-principles quantum mechanical method is developed to evaluate the optical responses of large molecular systems. Instead of a many-body wave function, the equation of motion is solved for the reduced single-electron density matrix in the time domain. The locality of the reduced single-electron density matrix is utilized to ensure that computational time scales linearly with system size. The two-electron Coulomb integrals are evaluated with the fast multipole method, and the calculation of exchange-correlation quadratures utilizes the locality of an exchange-correlation functional and the integral prescreening technique. As an illustration, the resulting time-dependent density-functional theory is used to calculate the absorption spectra of polyacetylene oligomers and linear alkanes. The linear-scaling of computational time versus the system size is clearly demonstrated.
