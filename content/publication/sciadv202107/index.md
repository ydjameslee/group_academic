abstract: Using an innovative quantum mechanical method for an open quantum system, we observe in real time and space the generation, migration, and dissociation of electron-hole pairs, transport of electrons and holes, and current emergence in an organic photovoltaic cell. Ehrenfest dynamics is used to study photoexcitation of thiophene:fullerene stacks coupled with a time-dependent density functional tight-binding method. Our results display the generation of an electron-hole pair in the donor and its subsequent migration to the donor-acceptor interface. At the interface, electrons transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of thiophenes to the second LUMOs of fullerene. Further migration of electrons and holes leads to the emergence of current. These findings support previous experimental evidence of coherent couplings between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom and are expected to stimulate further work toward exploring the interplay between electron-hole pair (exciton) binding and vibronic coupling for charge separation and transport.
