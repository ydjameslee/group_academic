abstract: Environmental effects play an important role on the electron dynamics of open systems, which provide channels for dissipation of electrons and energy in the systems. However, accurate description of the environment of quantum systems is still challenging. The environment is usually assumed to be a quasi-one-dimensional reservoir in previous theoretical studies. In this work, we focus on systems that are adsorbed on bulk surfaces. Two different approaches to describe the spectral details of the environment are adopted and compared: the Lorentzian decomposition approach and the complex absorbing potential (CAP) approach. To achieve similar accuracy for the spectral density of the environment, it is shown that the Lorentzian decomposition approach is computationally more efficient than the CAP approach, especially for bulk systems. The electron dynamics is then followed using the nonequilibrium Green’s function method for two systems: a modeling bulk surface system and a scanning tunneling microscope junction. Dissipation paths of excited charge carriers can be analyzed, which provide insights into the understanding of excitation dynamics in bulk materials.
