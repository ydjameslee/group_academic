abstract: We reported in a previous study (Zhao et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 175504) that energy transfer from the orderly intertube translational oscillation to intratube vibrational modes for an isolated system of two coaxial carbon nanotubes at low temperatures takes place primarily via two distinct types of collective motion of the carbon nanotubes, i.e., off-axial rocking motion of the inner tube and radial wavy motion of the outer tube, and that these types of motion may or may not occur for such a system, depending upon the amount of the initial extrusion of the inner tube out of the outer tube. Our present study, using micro-canonical molecular dynamics (MD), indicates the existence of an energy threshold, largely independent of system sizes and configurations, for a double-walled nano-oscillator to deviate from the intertube translational oscillation and thus to encounter significant intertube friction. The frictional forces associated with several distinct dissipative mechanisms are all found to exhibit no proportional dependence upon the normal force between the two surfaces in relative sliding, contrary to the conventional understanding resulting from tribological studies of macroscopic systems. Furthermore, simulation has been performed at different initial temperatures, revealing a strong temperature dependence of friction in the early phase of oscillation. Finally, our studies of three-walled nano-oscillators show that an initial extrusion of the middle tube can cause inner-tube off-axial instabilities, leading to strong frictional effects.
