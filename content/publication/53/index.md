abstract: In this work, we simulate a realistic junctionless (JL) field-effect transistor using a multi-scale approach. Our approach features a combination of the first-principles atomistic calculation, semi-classical semiconductor device simulation, compact model generation, and circuit simulation. The transfer characteristics of JL transistors are simulated by a recently developed quantum mechanical/electromagnetics method, and good agreement is obtained compared to experiment. A compact model for JL transistors is then generated for subsequent circuit simulation. We demonstrate a multi-scale modeling framework for quantum mechanical effects in nano-scale devices for next generation electronic design automation.
