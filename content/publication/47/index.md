abstract: The applicability of quantum mechanical methods is severely limited by their poor scaling. To circumvent the problem, linear-scaling methods for quantum mechanical calculations had been developed. The physical basis of linear-scaling methods is the locality in quantum mechanics where the properties or observables of a system are weakly influenced by factors spatially far apart. Besides the substantial efforts spent on devising linear-scaling methods for ground state, there is also a growing interest in the development of linear-scaling methods for excited states. This review gives an overview of linear-scaling approaches for excited states solved in real time-domain..
